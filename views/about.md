### The Story

This was a little passion project made over one weekend in March 2017. Everyone always said that to progress as a developer you need to be reading other people's code. I always found this hard to do since more of the projects I was intersted seemed way to invovled to get into.

In comes rum, a framework that is about **120** lines of readable code. I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Instead of hoarding the knowledge I decided to share it for others to learn from.
