#### Lesson Goodbye

Thanks for hanging out, I hope you managed to learn something new on your journey. I had a blast reading through rum's tiny library and understanding how it all works. The last step now is up to you! What will you do with this new knowldge? Maybe find some other gem that interests you and dig into rhat code, who knows what you'll be able to learn.

I want to leave you with one more challange. Take the [rum](https://github.com/chneukirchen/rum) source code and make your own beast! Here is mine: [repo](https://github.com/AlessandroMinali/rye). <sub><sup>Hint hint, it's actually this entire website you've been on! Cool huh?</sub></sup>

I ripped rum to shreds and made it work for me. I have heavily commented all the code so if you are interested there is even more to explore at your own pace.

If you manage to make any rum creations of your own feel free to show them off to [me](/about) or your friends. And as always, if you see something you can improve on in my code send me a pull request!

See you around, I think now I'm going to go [camping](https://github.com/camping/camping).
