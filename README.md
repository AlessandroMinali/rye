Rye is toy framework built from the guts of <a href="https://github.com/chneukirchen/rum" target="_blank">rum</a> with an accompanying tutorial teaching us how rum works and what we can do with that knowledge.

This is a 4 part series that goes from zero knowledge to deploying a custom <a href="http://rack.github.io" target="_blank">rack</a> app!

Want to run the website on your local?

    bundle
    rackup

Easy peasy!

For a detailed breakdown of the custom code I made to host these tutorials go to <a href="https://github.com/AlessandroMinali/rye/blob/master/lib/rye.rb" target="_blank">here</a>.

Pull requests welcome.
